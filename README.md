# React 19 New Feature

React 19 is coming soon ðŸ”¥. Do you know the major updates?

âœ… The React Compiler:
â†’ Converts React code into regular JavaScript, potentially doubling performance.
â†’ React developers traditionally used manual memoization techniques, like useMemo, useCallback, and memo APIs, to manage re-rendering behavior with state changes. However, the React team recognizes that manual memoization introduces compromises, including code clutter, potential errors, and heightened maintenance efforts.
â†’ React applications often face the challenge of re-rendering too frequently when the application state changes. The compiler aims to automatically identify and optimize these scenarios.

âœ… Actions:
â†’ Simplify handling of data and interactions within web pages.

âœ… Server Components:
â†’ Render on the server for faster page loads and better SEO.
â†’ Integration with Server Actions allows seamless data transfer between the client and server.

âœ… Asset Loading:
â†’ Background loading of assets for smoother page transitions.
â†’ New Resource Loading APIs such as preload and preinit for better control over when resources load.

âœ… Document Metadata:
â†’ Easy SEO enhancements with the <DocumentHead> component.

âœ… Web Components:
â†’ Improved compatibility for more flexible development.

âœ… Enhanced Hooks:
â†’ More control over component lifecycle and state.
â†’ New hooks like useFormStatus, useFormState and useOptimistic.
